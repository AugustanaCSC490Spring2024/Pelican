# PELICAN MARKETPLACE WEB APP

A centralized platform for users to buy, sell, exchange, and donate goods and services within campus community.
We utilized React.js as well as Firebase in order to allow users to post products to be stored in the Firebase storage.
These stored products can be seen by any logged in Augustana User in order to be potentially bought by them. 

How it works:

Buyer:
Augustana Student logs in through Google Authentication, this student searches an item they are interested, they click on the item.
Once they click on the item, the student can see the item's details and then chat the seller if they are interested.

Seller:
Augustana Student logs in using Google, this student goes to the posting page and posts details about their item. They can then wait for buyers to see and chat them about their item.
